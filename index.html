                    The CFD simulation accuracy mostly depends on the appropriate setting of boundary conditions and numerical simulation parameters. This study shows the influence of two types of boundary condition settings on the CFD simulation results of Double-Skin Facade (DSF) for a specific problem. These two boundary settings are the constant temperature on the DSF surfaces called Boundary A, and Boundary B is defined via solar radiation using the Discrete Ordinate radiation Model (DOM). The paper verified both the numerical simulations using the experimental data. Comparing the numerical results of two types of boundaries with experimental data shows that both cases underestimated the values lower than 5.2 K and 0.1 m/s for the temperature and velocity respectively at the regarded measured points. Boundary A gives more accurate temperature prediction results, while Boundary B shows velocity magnitude closer to the measurements in the middle height of the cavity; the average temperature and velocity differences between the two boundary types are 0.6 K and 0.003 m/s respectively which are negligible. Finally, the selection of boundary conditions depends on study purposes, however, when the DSF is equipped with blinds and if there is not enough data in hand but the exact value of solar irradiation, using the Boundary B approach is suggested; it can provide reasonable results associated with multi-type of thermal boundary conditions at the same time. Furthermore, if the goal is to investigate the flow pattern in the DSF, Boundary B is argued to perform better than the constant temperature boundary conditions.

                   Numerous studies have only focused on vertical air channel performance, but there is still a need to perform in-depth research on the flow and heat transfer characteristics of atypical double skin façade (DSF) such as folded cases. A 2D steady-state numerical study was conducted using ANSYS-Fluent 18 to evaluate the impact of four inclination angles and fold positions on DSF thermal performance. The simulation data were compared with a typical validated vertical DSF as the base case. The folded DSFs could decrease the average cavity and surface temperature by 2.4 °C through improving natural convection. The folded cases enhanced the airflow rate up to 27% higher than the base case supporting the folded geometries for building integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) DSF application.

                   The main idea of designing buildings with double skin facades is to achieve sustainable architectural goals. Considering the importance of reducing energy consumption in buildings as well as various factors preventing energy loss, it is regarded that how deep the cavity between double skins is in most appropriate building with double skin façade in a particular climate in terms of optimal use of heating and cooling energy, and it is determined that how much energy is used by each floor in the building to meet the residents’ comfort. The method used in this research is modeling and software calculations. A chamber with the length of 5 m, the width of 4 m and height of 3 m in three floors with double skin facades at 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 cm depths was modeled to be compared with a single skin façade using ECOTECT 10. After defining it in the Energy Plus software, cooling and heating load of the chamber was analyzed. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the thermal performance of double skin facades with different depths in the climate of Karaj city. First, the validity of ECOTECT and Energy Plus software was investigated, and then the results were obtained regarding the use of double skin façade compared with the simple façade. The results showed DSFs have a great ability in order to minimize cooling and heating load during operation periods of building even in hot climates such as Tehran. Finally, comparing heating and cooling energy consumption for all depths with respect to environmental factors, it was annually selected that double skin façade with a depth of 20 cm is the best option which results in about 34% reduction in energy consumption.

                  Vernacular architecture in each climate had always been in harmony with its surrounding in all micro-climates. The typology, configuration, and skeleton of the regraded architecture are trying to respond to the environmental condition and provide a beneficial comfort zone and humanitarian relief. In this perspective, conserving the buildings from unwanted cold and harsh hot air has been one of the priorities of vernacular buildings as a passive design. The envelope of each building provides a barrier between inside and outside and has a significant impact on reducing energy consumption in it. In hot and humid climates, some general techniques could help energy efficiency performance of buildings; they are namely: thick urban texture, semi-closed urban spaces, and expansion along the coastal line encountering the sea and using large and wide paths. Some physical and formal features of the hot and humid climate are inner court, shading and cross ventilation, high ceilings and large windows, semi-open spaces called "Ivans," and basement-removed spaces. However, it has not been studied that vernacular buildings envelope performance in energy consumption to improve IAQ in hot and humid climates. This quantitative study tries to assess a Bushehr vernacular home by simulating its energy performance by introducing related boundary conditions using the Design-Builder simulation tool. The openings of the Rashidy home import maximum light and temperate air to the inside and reduce cooling loads efficiently. Using numerical analysis, it was also shown that the openings substantially provide indoor thermal comfort by its position, sizing, and configuration in two-scale urban and building scales. The CFD analysis in the two mentioned scales somewhat proved and validated the primary purpose of vernacular architects and their efficient thinking. The first raw results show that studies of a vernacular buildings can lead us to more efficient future design in the future.
